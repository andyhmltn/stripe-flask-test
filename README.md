Stripe/Flask Test
=====================

This is a test. I'm trying out both the Flask framework and the payment provider 'Stripe' using their UK beta. 

Getting Started
=====================
First, you need to import the database:

	sqlite3 /tmp/payments.db < schema.sql

Next, rename `config.py.sample` to `config.py` and edit to your liking.

Then just run `python main.py`... Enjoy!
